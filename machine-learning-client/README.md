## EyeWrite ML Client

This service reads webcam frames, detects eye/iris landmarks with MediaPipe, runs a simple 5-point calibration, estimates screen gaze coordinates, and sends them to the Flask web app.

## Features in MVP

- Webcam feed and live face/iris processing
- Eye landmark-based gaze feature extraction
- Simple 5-point calibration (`center`, corners)
- Smoothed gaze estimate output
- HTTP push to web app `/api/gaze`

## Run

Requires Python 3.11 for MediaPipe FaceMesh compatibility.

If you previously created this env with another Python version, recreate it first:

```bash
python -m pipenv --rm
python -m pipenv --python 3.11
```

1. Move into the service folder:

```bash
cd machine-learning-client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pipenv install
```

3. Start tracker:

```bash
python -m pipenv run python src/tracker.py --api-url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/gaze
```

4. Calibration flow:
- Look at highlighted dot
- Press `SPACE` repeatedly until it advances
- Repeat for all 5 points
- Press `Q` to quit
