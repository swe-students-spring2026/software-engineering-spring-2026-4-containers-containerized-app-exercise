## Project Description

This project is a containerized actor training platform built with three connected subsystems: a Flask web app, a machine learning client, and a MongoDB database.

The platform asks users to perform target emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral. The machine learning client processes facial images and evaluates how strongly the user’s expression matches the requested emotion. The database stores scan records, emotion scores, timestamps, and grading results so that the web app and machine learning client can use the same shared data.
